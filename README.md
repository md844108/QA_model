# QA_model
## AIM : 
Here I am implementing a QA model in which you upload files of any type and can also give a git link. After that, you can ask questions based on the information available in the document.

## The following are the concepts, tools, and libraries that I used to build this prototype:
    Semantic search.
    Embeddings.
    Facebook Faiss.
    langchain.
    Openaiâ€™s GPT-3.
